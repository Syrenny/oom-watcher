# ExecPlans

When writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in .agent/PLANS.md) from design to implementation.

## Language

All non-code artifacts must be written in Russian unless the user explicitly asks otherwise.

This includes:
- ExecPlans
- progress updates
- decision logs
- retrospectives
- final summaries
- PR descriptions
- review notes
- task documentation

Keep code identifiers, public API names, filenames, commands, logs, and error messages in their original language.

## ExecPlan usage

Use an ExecPlan only for complex or risky tasks.

Use an ExecPlan when the task includes at least one of:
- significant feature work
- significant refactoring
- database migrations
- changes across multiple layers
- API contract changes
- background jobs or async flows
- security/auth/payment-related logic
- performance-sensitive changes
- unclear requirements that require research

Do not use an ExecPlan for:
- small bug fixes
- simple validation changes
- copy/text changes
- renaming
- formatting
- adding one small test
- changing one isolated function
- mechanical cleanup

If the user says "без ExecPlan", "no ExecPlan", "quick fix", or "just implement", do not create or update an ExecPlan.
Proceed directly with the smallest safe change.
